# Car Theft Monitor
Android program that uses automatic license plate recognition to look out for stolen cars, cars under AMBER alert, stolen tags and similar things. The program is meant to be used like a dash camera where the user would mount the camera when driving and the phone would keep taking pictures at regular intervals to look for given criteria. Upon noticing a flagged car, it can automatically inform the police with a picture of the car.

The program is a proof of concept and not to be used in large scale.
